In the Folder BlueJ you can find the versions of the code that are usable in BlueJ.
In the normal Folder you can find the non-BlueJ (standard Java) versions of the code.
I would recommend using the BlueJ versions for preparing for school and using the normal version for things that go beyound that, because it will enable you to have a look in code you would use in real-life (because no company uses BlueJ).
